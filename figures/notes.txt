# Have to decrease time-step
# Increasing N of steps is what is important

# Steady state might not exist
# Becomes philosophical
# -> Steady state is likely to exist, but might not be stable (think of perturbing)

# Good initial guess

# See how solutions vary with Re (recirculation areas in bottom left and right)
# Symmetry should be broken with increasing Re

# Increasing Re should make the problem unstable
# Iterative should win here (Newton would find the unstable steady)

# Find the critical Re
# Could also try finding it by trying lots of values of Re (time consuming)
